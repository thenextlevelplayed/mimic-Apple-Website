                    1. Qualified&nbsp;Purchasers receive an Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card when they purchase an eligible Mac or iPad at a Qualifying&nbsp;Location. Only one Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card per eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified&nbsp;Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple&nbsp;Card&nbsp;Monthly&nbsp;Installment&nbsp;(ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified&nbsp;Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple&nbsp;Gift&nbsp;Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable&nbsp;APRs for Apple&nbsp;Card other than ACMI range from 13.24% to 24.24% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of August 1, 2022. If you choose the pay‑in‑full or one‑time‑payment option for an ACMI‑eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple&nbsp;Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple&nbsp;Card&nbsp;Customer&nbsp;Agreement at
